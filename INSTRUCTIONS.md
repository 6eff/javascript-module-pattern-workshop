# JavaScript module pattern

## Starter (10 minutes)

* Talk about the [high level goal of the week](README.md#high-level-goal-for-the-week).

* Do "thumbs" on the [learning objectives](README.md#learning-objectives).

* Spend five minutes talking through the high level ideas of the module pattern, using the code in this repo for examples.

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

## Main (30 minutes)

* Ask the students to investigate the code in this repo to find out how it works.

* Suggest they use `console.log` to inspect the state and follow the flow.  Suggest they research the module pattern to understand what problems it solves, and what trade-offs it makes.

* Ask them to try and answer the [questions](README.md#questions) in the README.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* Ask the students what techniques they used to understand the code in the repo

* Ask the students to answer the [questions](README.md#questions) in the README.

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

[No PLENARY.md because there's not really much material besides the questions above.]
